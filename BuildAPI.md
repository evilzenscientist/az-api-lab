# Building a local .NET API.
[Back to main](README.md)

This tutorial walks you through building a local API with basic GET functionality.  The goal is not to build a useful API, but rather a base API that responds to simple GET queries to be used as a building block for testing APIM.

From VS code, run the following in the terminal to build a basic webapp named "vehicle":

`dotnet new webapi -minimal -o vehicle`

troubleshooting note:
Twice on fresh installs I ran into the following error -

If this happens, move into the project directory ('vehicle' in the example above) and run the following command:

`dotnet add vehicle.csproj package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore -v 6.2.3 -s https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`

Run `code -r ..\vehicle` to reload VS Code with your project (if you didn't have the error above, simply run `code -r vehicle`o

If you get this message, click 'yes':

Now open the `Program.cs` file in your project.  Lines 17 through 38 should look like this:

Delete everything from lines 19 to 36 and add one line: `app.MapGet("/", () => "Vehicle API");`

From here, save your file and press CTRL+F5 to run a test.  A browser will open and you should have your API running:

In the code, let's add a couple additional GET calls, as well as removing everything after the `app.Run()` line:

After running it again, you should be able to test the three new GET calls.  This is just one sample using `/startengine`
